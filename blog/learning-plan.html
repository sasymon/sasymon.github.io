      <h2>Learning plan</h2>
      <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>I have modest long term goals at the moment, but with a tentative eye towards Information analytics in the next 10 years. After graduating 
        I'd like to join an established company to build some experience and keep building skills as I work. After establishing myself within that 
        environment, ~2-3years, I would ideally start working towards newer qualifications that would expand my options and opportunity ie analytics.
      </p>
      <p>
        None of this is set in stone, I'm still seeing which part of development suits me and which I like most. It's almost guaranteed to changed.
      </p>
      <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3>
      <p>
        My own learning limitations are mostly set by my willingness to ask for help, and how I manage my focus.
      </p>
      <p>I have strengths in being able to breakdown information into simplistic terms and concepts. This is useful when start out on something tangentily 
        related to a topic I already know a litle about but with things that are new it has to be fed to me in a certain order or from a broad context and 
        then get more specific as we get deeper, so as the course goes on I should get better at grasping concepts as I'll have more references to relate back 
        to. I also have trouble remembering terminology and their applicable contexts
      </p>
      <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>    
      <p>
        How to communicate my thoughts/ideas/understanding of issues/problems/solutions to others effectively. If there's a topic I'm confident in with my 
        knowledge and own practical application I can sometimes stumble around and failing to articulate it in easily digestible terms. This relates back to 
        why I have difficulty asking for help; I've encountered very few people who think like I do.
      </p>
      <h3>My commitment to managing my workload in this programme</h3>
      <h4>Time management and schedule</h4>
      <p>I've set myself up a flexible but determined schedule to work on EDA material each day; Monday and tuesday I go into the Re-leased offices to start 
        the week and get things rolling after the weekend, wednesday and thursday I'll be spending at home where I have my own private space to work out of; 
        it's taking family some adjusting to understand that I'm not available even though I am here but I'm sure they will get there.
      </p>
      <p>
        I start working on material at 9.30am every weekday, my time is 'blocked' into 1-1.5hour slots including a 15min rest period. I try to do two of these 
        before lunch, then another 2 after lunch. If I'm at Re-leased I'll generally leave around 4.30pm, after dinner I'll practice my typing for about an hour. 
        It's important for me to stick to routine, without one I can easily wander from task to task and not accomplish all that much.
      </p>
      <h4>How will you manage to work constructively and productively with other students and the facilitators?</h4>
      <p>
        My communication style is very direct, and I've adopted a few ways to take the edge off; ask questions instead of giving direct criticism, include my own 
        personal troubles when someone is frustrated with something, use 'soft' words like maybe/perhaps and choose verbage that is nuetral, and I try to use a 
        more even tone when speaking in person.
      </p>
      <h4>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?</h4>
      <p>
        I'm not shy about talking about things that are frustrating or upsetting me. I learned long ago that it doesn't help to keep things inside so I have friends, 
        a partner, and family to talk to about social issues, and my facilitator when it involves other students. Sometimes I just need time to process things aswell.
      </p>
      <h4>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h4>
      <p>Asking for help is something that I've been working on recently on in my own time, I'm a pretty self sufficient person so unless I'm working within a team 
        I see my problems as my own, which is a difficult mindset to break. I'm sure that as time passes and I get to know the facilitators and other students this 
        will becomes less difficult for me.
      </p>
      <h4>What I expect from the facilitation team</h4>
      <p>
        I expect my facilitator to be my conduit to the course material. Feedback on how I'm doing, general or specific, as well my perception of the material; it goes 
        both ways. I also expect some guidance, and someone to go to with problems whether they're technical or 'core skills' related.
