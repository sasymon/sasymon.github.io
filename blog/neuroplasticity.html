                Neuro = brain.       Plasticity = capability of change.
            </p>
            <p>
                Neuroplasticity is the term given to describe the brains physical change and adaptation to learning something new, 
                relearning how to do something, or relating an existing skills to a newly learned one;  as we practice and learn our 
                brain strengthens nueral connections the more we engage those connections, and if we neglect practicing those skills 
                those connections degrade away.

            <p>
                How to engage with neuroplasticity can be describe under 10 main principles:
                <ul>
                    <li><span style='font-style: bold'>Use it or lose it</span> - Failure to reinforce specific neural pathways can lead to loss of ability.</li>
                    <li><span style='font-style: bold'>Use it and improve it</span> - Training can lead to improving and strengthening abilities.</li>
                    <li><span style='font-style: bold'>Specificity</span> - The nature of the training experience dictates the nature of the change in nueral pathways.</li>
                    <li><span style='font-style: bold'>Repetition matters</span> - Change requires sufficient repetition</li>
                    <li><span style='font-style: bold'>Intensity matters</span> - Change requires the brain to be challenged to reinforce neural pathways</li>
                    <li><span style='font-style: bold'>Time matters</span> - Different forms of change in the brain happen at different times during training</li>
                    <li><span style='font-style: bold'>Salience matters</span> - The training or challenges should be meaningful to the person</li>
                    <li><span style='font-style: bold'>Age matters</span> - Plasticity occurs more easily in younger brains</li>
                    <li><span style='font-style: bold'>Transference</span> - A change in one skill or ability can lead to learning in similar skill areas</li>
                    <li><span style='font-style: bold'>Interference</span> - Learned bad habits can interfer with learning good habits</li>
                </ul>

            <h4>How does neurplasticity apply to me as a student learning code?</h4>
            <p>
                My profession background before joining EDA was in cooking and baking. I learned very early that practice and repetition was necessary to perfect a skill. 
                A basic skill in making bread is learning to round your portioned dough; at first it feels unnatural and uninituitive, uncomfortable, but after rounding 100 
                loaves it starts to feel better. 200 and you're getting the knack of it. 500 and you're beginning to understand how it works. 1000 you can do it, but you still 
                feel slow. 2000 hey, this feels good, intuitive. 5000, you're not even thinking about what you're doing, it's automotous. 10,000 and now I'm teaching others 
                how to do it.
            </p>
             <p>
                    It took me 9 months how to learn how to round dough with confidence, speed, and accuracy, and that's just one skill within a kitchen. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This is how I envision myself learning code. It's repetition and practice, deliberately challenging myself in terms of understanding, capability, and knowledge. 
                Sometimes there's transferable skills like in cooking and baking, and sometimes I'll be learning something from scratch, but I'll still be learning and trying to 
                relate it back to my existing skills. 
            </p>
        <h3>Growth mindset</h3>
            <p>
                The idea of <span style="font-style:bold">not yet.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                It use to be believed that our skills and talents, our capabilities, were determined by genetics; we were all good at what we were good at and that was it for 
                our life time. Not only is this just outright false, but even believing that to be true can have a knock on effect to make it more difficult to learn something new.
            </p>
            <p>
                The impact our self belief can have on our ability to learn new things can be subtle and easily overlooked. If we think we can achieve something then we will put 
                in more effort into our actions to be successful, but if we believe we're not good at the task at hand then we will put in less effort into our actions, maybe simply 
                not act at all, and the prophecy will come true; we will eventually fail.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having a growth mindset will not directly enable success, and failure can still happen, it can have a cascading effect from belief -> action -> progress -> success. 
                Without taking action, we cannot progress to then succeed, and belief in achieving that success can be a catalyst to action. 
                To cultivate a growth mind is to believe that though I cannot do this task now I can learn to do it for the future. It's telling yourself 'Not yet' instead of 'I can't'.
            </p>

            <h4>How will I cultivate a growth mindset?</h4>
            <p>
                I will try. I will make an effort despite how daunting it may look.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having a growth mindset is a process of building your own self confidence. When learning something new it is difficult to accept our initial limitations and it's easy 
                to give in when things seem too hard. So, I will break the larger challenged down into smaller challenges, put road markers where I would to be, make it more manageable 
                to get wins here and there, then the culminations of these small wins will add to my confidence, and that perhaps, maybe, the big challenges aren't so big after all.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will look back at where I was, and where I am now, relfect on the road travelled and the challenges beaten. Nothing builds confidence like seeing your own progress, 
                and where you've come from.
