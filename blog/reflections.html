            <h2>Reflections</h2>
            <h3>Ego and growth</h3>
            <p> 
                During the core learning for foundations we're introduced to concepts around self criticism and belief, communication, reflection, journal keeping, 
                learning to learn better, mindset, and emotional intelligence. By no means an exhaustive list, I've found that many of these things,and a few I have 
                adopted, are just being presented in different ways or under different titles; having a growth mindset to me is just the belief that I am capable of 
                getting better at new and old skills, emotional intelligence is understanding yours and others emotions, as examples.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of these concepts or ideas I had neglected, dismissed, or simply stopped utilising as often. Active meditation is something that still isn't for 
                me, but I can utilise some of the techniques found in meditation to calm myself, readjust my focus, clear my mind, and reset. Journalling is a habit I 
                have never been able to maintain, but it's still helpful to relfect on my day, what I've achieved and learned, where I've struggled and what to look to 
                improve in the future. The underlying lessons are more important than adhering to the instructions laid out.
            </p>
            <p>
                It has been interesting to read about things like EQ, neuroplasticity, loops & listen communication, and growth mindset. They were lessons that I still 
                have improvements, or habits to maintain, in some areas like communication - I'm not always consciously listening, EQ - I could be better at understanding 
                my own emotions more readily, and my mindset isn't a always in a growth position, sometimes it regresses when I'm stuck or feeling like I'm achieving things 
                as quickly as I presumed I would.
            </p> 
            <h3>Empathy, values, and self awareness in learning</h3>
            <p>
                Learning, and specifically learning code, is helped immensely by being aware of your mental state. If you're tired, stressed, frustrated, or even just 
                hungry or dehydrated, they can start a feedback loop and escalate your emotions beyond what is manageable. It's healthier, and more productive, to catch 
                them early and manage them. I had a day where I felt like I was just treading water making little progress, so I turned off my screen and went outside 
                for an hour. Came back and while I didn't immediately solve the challenge, I did feel better doing it and learned something other than why a single 
                syntax error can break and entire page of code.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think that understanding what others are struggling with in the current learning content helps to reinforce what we've learnt ourselves and to gain 
                perspective, maybe learn another approach to the current content or challenge. A lot of initial learning is done through relating the present content 
                to previously learned skills and knowledge, and since we're all have varied and different life experiences sometimes the way someone else relates to the 
                content can help you, or you gelp them, grasp it more easily.
            </p>
            <h3>Surprise! It's coding!</h3>
            <p>
                Coming into foundations, in my admitted ignorance, I made the assumption that learning code would be arduous and dry, it'd be learning proper strict 
                syntax and formatting and equations. Of course some of it IS that, but there's a lot more freedom to it, there's no 'best way' to write code, there's many 
                solutions to the same problem (usually). The best code is the code that works, is readable, easy to manage, and most of all what the individual coder prefers.
            </p>
            <h3>Challenges in learning to code</h3>
            <p>
                Coding from the outside looked like a daunting unmoving monolith, looming over new coders ready to crush them if they got to close. It's really not, 
                understanding what code does is the easier part (but not easy!), it's writing your own code from scratch that works.
            </p>
            <p>
                Learning to code is that it's a amrathon. It's endurance to get to a point where you have enough knowledge to get to the next part, and there's always 
                a 'next part'. it's impossible to know everything in coding, and accepting that is an important lesson for anyone learning to code needs to have.
            </p>
            <h2>The importance of core skills</h2>
            <p>
                The core skills part of the cirriculum was a large reason why I liked what EDA was offering. Partly because it shows that the philosophy at EDA is one 
                of creating good employees and work mates over just creating good coders. I have the fortuity to be doing this course out of an office environment surrounded 
                by professional programmers, and if the work environment and work flow is indicative of the industry as a whole then it's one of collaboration and leaning 
                on each other to find solutions to problems. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Programmers HAVE to work with each other, providing the foundation for the skills required to do that is well worth the time investment.weEven if at times 
                it feels like you could be getting that code written instead. 
            </p>
