            <h2>Bootcamp learning plan</h2>
            <h3>Looking back</h3>
            <p> 
                Completing foundations has given me a foundation (ha!) to assess my capabilities and expectations for EDA bootcamp. When we started I was a bit anxious and 
                very apprehensive, but the EDA approach of easing their students into the the content was a great way to introduce them to the learning environment. At the 
                end of each sprint I could look back on my work and see the improvements I was making from the previous week, which is gratifying and encouraging. I did find 
                myself questioning if some of their challenges and instructions were presented in a way that required interpretation, that part of the challenge was deciphering 
                what was presented to me, or if was just accidents that lead to that. I like to give the benefit of the doubt that EDA knows what they're doing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also see what I could've done better. I could hold myself accountable more strictly to my study habits, interact with the other students and the facilitators 
                more, giving but mostly asking for more help. I think going into bootcamp I will need to be more strict with my schedule, particularly start times and getting 
                the appropriate amount of rest; sleep is the most important ingredient for a focused and capable mind.
            </p>
            <h3>Looking forward</h3>
            <p>
                Bootcamp will be tough, how tough I'm not exactly sure. My approach to learning helps with actual coding; breaking down and simplifying the knowledge to build from, 
                but if I can't do that I will struggle to gain momentum. I'm hoping that the structure schedule of learning will help keep me focused and on track, but I am concerned 
                if that I don't grasp a concept in a timely manner that I may be left behind.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Some days I will struggle and lean on others for help, other days I'll be the one being leant on, I'll take those experiences as they come, adapt do what I can; I've 
                had to work hard and long hours in the past though not in a study environment. I am tentative, anxious, hopeful, excited, concerned, all good feelings to have. Above 
                all else I will try, perhaps not to my best at times, but I will try to learn and achieve what I can, and even when I fall short the disappointment will be tempered 
                by the knowledge that I tried, and then I will try again.
            </p> 
            <p>
                I am hopeful that during bootcamp my interpersonal skills will be strengthened, particularly my communication when it comes to conveying concepts, ideas, and problem solving. 
                I hope there is an opportunity to gain some networking skills, something I have little experience with; I have difficulty with asking for 'favours' or even offering them, 
                it's likely a part of my independent nature. Something to work on.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my first Learning plan I gave a nonspecific answer to what career plans I had at the time. Not much has changed, I'm still not sure where I'll land but the general 
                broad strokes I painted are still where I would like to be. My goals are modest, I personally don't have that strong ambitious drive that many others do, though I do 
                know that productive people are happy people, we like to feel useful, and I would like to be happy in my work.
            </p>
            <p>
                One thing I will try to maintain during the next ~3months is how I spend my time outside of bootcamp. I think it's really important for me to give my mind a rest, 
                to recharge, but mostly to keep my life outside of EDA rolling; official training for football starts in February, Saturday will still be for my partner and I to be 
                together, Monday night for boardgames. Burn out is a sapping experience, something to be avoided, so managing my time and energy will be important.
