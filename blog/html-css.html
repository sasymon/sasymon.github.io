        <h2>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h3>
        <h3>What are classes and ids</h2>
        <p>Classes and ids are selectors. Selectors help define elements (contents of a webpage); think of them as containers that hold content and help tell them what to do.</p>
        <p>Class and id selectors define a ruleset under a given value, usually in an external stylesheet. We can then give these rulesets to elements on our webpage by attributing the given value to elements. For example we can turn this text green, or assign it a different font.</p>
        <p>Classes are defined in the stylesheet by a <button>.</button> followed by a value, and ids by a <button>#</button>, followed by a value. </p>
        <h3>What's the difference between classes and ids?</h3>
        <p>Classes and ids function in much the same manner, the difference lies in their application:
            <ul>
                <li>id selectors only can be used on ONE element on a webpage.</li>
                <li>Class selectors can be used on any number of elements.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Elements are also able to have multiple of either classes or ids, when this is the case and there's conflicting instructions the order in which they are written in the stylesheet matters, the last one taking precedence.</p>
        <p>When an element has both a class and an id, the id will always take precedence. This allows for what's called specificity; you can get really specific when you apply multiple different classes and ids to the same element!</p>
        <h3>When to use a class or an id?</h3>
        <p>It's generally good practice to use classes when you're wanting to style multiple elements, and id when you're styling a specific element. </p>
        <p>Addtionally, because ids are unique on a webpage they can also be referred to within the code by using it in a hyperlink.</p>
