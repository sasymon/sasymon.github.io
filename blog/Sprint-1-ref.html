    <h2>Sprint 1</h2>
    <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make</h3>
    <p>While working at a bakery we had a small team; the owner/head baker, three senior bakers, and a junior baker. We were a team, and while we all had our differences we helped each other and the 4 employee bakers became friends and spent time outside of work; I taught one of them how to drive and took them to their tests, another reintroduced me to playing football, we were friends.</p>
    <p>Hawke's Bay restaurant and tourist scene is very seasonal; winter is slow, while summer is incredibly busy. Being hourly employees during the winter season when our workload was measurably lower our weekly hours would be lower, and when the workload increased so did our working hours. This was accepted by both employer and employee, Over a few seasons as the business grew and grew, our workloads would increase. We managed, worked as a team, helping and supporting each other.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately no matter how hard or efficient you work eventually there's a strain, and it's becomes an unreasonable workload. Others were being stretched, and myself as well. Even then owner was overworked, stressed, and tired from his successfully growing business. The first season we managed, and got through it, and things felt better as we went into the winter season. Second season, again we were working long hours with no relief signaled beyond the cool of winter.</p> 
    <p>Beginning on the third season. We were already understaffed and overworked. What should be a 7 person workload was instead being covered by 4.5 and things were only set to increase. Being the longest standing employee, I spoke to the owner and expressed our situation, I thought him to be a reasonable man and gave the impression that we was listening. A month goes by, two, then another. We're half way into the season now and it's clear again that no relief is coming.   Personally, I was holding on for the other bakers. We needed each other, without one of us it would've fallen apart, but I had a choice to make. I either continue with the status quo, sacrificing mental and physical health for the benefit of my friends (and my employer), or leave to look after myself; to be selfless or selfish. I think that we're taught as children that being selfish is bad, but now I think sometimes not being selfish is worse.</p> 
    <p>Ultimately I left that job, my friends did the same, some before me. I came to find out that one of our replacements had a heart attack from the stress and physical demands of the job (he survived), and it's a reminder that while sacrificing your own wellbeing to hold up others can be admirable, sometimes the right call is to be selfish to look after yourself.</p>
    <h3>How has your cultural shaped you</h3>
    <p>Growing up in NZ I feel fortunate, but growing up with little means less fortunate. All of the opportunities I have enjoyed happened because my personal circumstances have allowed it, though every achievement and failure I worked hard at I am proud to claim as my own. it's self evident that had I been raised somewhere else or not grown up with hardship my life and person would be measurably different. Growing up working class, mingling with different ethnicities and cultures has given me an accepting and humbling outlook on the world; no one owes me anything, I have to work for the things I want, but just having the opportunity to be able to work for them is truly fortuitous.</p>
    <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of learning and career development</h3>    
    <p>Inside learning environments my approach is to simplify the information/knowledge, get it down to its base principles and application to the current topic/lesson. This allows me to grasp more complicated ideas and concept as the start and then build on that gain deeper understanding. Unfortunately when this isn't approach is too difficult, it can take a while to learn something new until it 'clicks'. This has alllowed me to gain a quick grasp when learning something new, it can be superficial and not indicative to my capability; understanding something is not the same as being able to perform it.</p>
    <p>A large limitation when building a career is my lack of networking skills. WHen I was younger I didn't pput much value into networking or impressing myself onto others; I believed that I would rewarded accordingly on the merit of the work I did, how efficient I was, and how well it came out. Now as I'm older I understand that those who deserve recognition don't always get it, and that I need to learn how to network my contacts within my choosen career industry to move up and find opportunities.</p>
    <h3>Discuss how you try to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension</h3>
    <p>My communication style is literal, straight forward, uncomplicated. I personally believe that it's a very positive trait in certain environments, but in more social or emotionally charged situations it can be a detriment.</p>
    <p>My straightforward communication style can cause tension in an off itself when others receive it as a personal indictment, and more so when I forget to consider their emotional and/or mental state. I've encounteed often that people just want to be heard, understood, and validated. There is a time to be constructive in criticism, observations, advice and times to just support and be present with others.</p>
    <p>When these situations arise in an environment where we have a task to accomplish I tend to take a step back and reassess; what's the priority here? 99% of the time helping someone else feel heard and valued will help them contribute, and then the group as a whole feel more cohesive and task orientated. A happy person will always be more productive than someone upset, frustrated, or otherwise mentally distraught. </p>
    <p>When I fail to initially notice how my communication style has hurt someone, I will apologise, and attempt to try to gain mutual understanding on what happened. It's difficult and not always successful, but I try.</p>
