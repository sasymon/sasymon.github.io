            <h2>Emotional intelligence</h2>
            <h3>What is Emotional intelligence?</h3>
            <p>The recognition of emotion in yourself and others. Deliberately being aware of these emotions, how they are being expressed through body language and actions, how they're impacting your mood and mindset. Your capability to actively help understand and manage them and gaining awareness of these emotions, as well as understanding where they come from, what that means, and why they're manifesting in the ways they are.</p>
            <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
            <p>IQ is the ability to process information and problem, it will help you through problems and information critically with logic, reason, and rational. EQ is recognising and understanding emotions in yourself and in others and using that to guide your actions and decisions. </p>
            <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
            <p>It gives us tools to navigate tough situations or conflicts when working with others, gives us a stronger sense of emapthy, to build and maintain better communication tools and relationships, and helps us be mindful of how our emotions influence behaviours and decisions in others as well as ourselves</p>
