            <h2>Problem solving</h2>
            <h3>Problem!</h3>
                <p>
                    During this sprint (4, for those keeping count) we had a challenge called 'FizzBuzz'. The purpose of the challenge was to teach 
                    students about particularly useful terms and in-built tools to help write code that is more efficient and well, looks prettier;
                     a single line of code is just more pleasing to the eye than doing the same thing over five lines.
                </p>
                <figure style='float: right'>
                    <img src='../imgs/picardfacepalm.jpg' alt='Picard facepalming at the obviousness of it all'>
                    <figcaption>Wow I feel REALLY silly.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    This particular part of the challenge asked us to filter out numbers that were factors of 3 and replace them with Fizz, factors 
                    of 5 and replace them with Buzz, and of course factors of 3 and 5 to be replaced with FizzBuzz. Seems easy right? You'd think. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting Fizz? Check. Getting Buzz? Check. Getting FizzBuzz? Uhh, not yet. Ok, let's try && operators; if two conditions separated 
                    by && are met, you get back a result. That should work. Didn't work. Alright let's try, filtering through the results of the previous 
                    Buzz (factors of 5) results... wait we can't, they're not numbers anymore. Ok. So how do we do that before changing the results in Bu... 
                    hang on. The lowest common denominator of that are factors of both 3 and 5 is 15, lets just try to filter for factors of 15 first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It worked. Of course it worked. Wow I feel silly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes it's important to take a step back from looking for a specific coding solution. Sometimes the solution comes from else where, 
                    like what you learned back in year 7 maths class.
                </p>
                <p style='font-size: 12px'>
                    Also read ALL the instructions in the handbook. The first step in the challenge says to filter for factors of both 3 and 5, then about 
                    ten lines below that it says to filter for factors of 15, but thats a much less dramatic story.
                </p>
            <h3>Problem solving techniques!</h3>
                <p>
                    Problem solving like many life skills can take many forms, some are suited for particular tasks and some are not; trying to iterate numerous 
                    times of making a better cake is a very resource and time costly endeavour, but it can be suited to code due to the quick feedback turnaround.
                </p>
                <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
                <p>
                    Pseudocode is a great way to break down what is you want your code to do without losing track of where you're at and what you need to do. 
                    Having a guide written in plain English and being able to relate it back to what your code is actually doing is very helpful for a methodical 
                    approach to writing code. 
                </p>
                <p>Javascriptt is a very logical language, though unforgiving, that can feel really dense if you're not familiar with it. Writing something in 
                    every day terms can help get your head around it.
                </p>
            <h3>Just... just try it</h3>
                <p>
                    Ah trial and error. We meet again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Trial and error has its place and is often my default approach to small problem solving, which lends itself well to code if you're writing 
                    small self contained bit of code at a time. The act of just trying something, with an educated and considered guess mind you, can get the result 
                    you need, but it can also lead to 'Wait, why does that work?'. If you want to then learn WHY something has work, you need to backtrack and 
                    sort of reverse engineer what's actually happening.
                </p>

            <h3>Rubber ducky method <span style='font-size: 12px'>aka talking to yourself</span></h3>
                <p>
                    The human brain is strange, it's easy to overlook details while mentally working through a problem, but when we're trying to articulate our 
                    problem with someone (or something) else we're forced to explain it in a way our audience can immediately intuit or understand. In that process 
                    we ourselves can have a eureka moment, solve the problem mid-sentence and feel sorry for wasting someone else time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This for me is a great way to improve my base understanding of the code I've written and what needs to be rectified. It often goes hand in 
                    hand with breaking down a problem into smaller more managable problems; solve A, B, then suddenly C through F come together.
                </p>
            <h3>Reading error messages and console.logging</h3>
          
                <p>
                    Error messages and console.logging are great tools for finding out what is actually happening behind the scenes, and what you code is actually 
                    returning. Admittedly I do need to learn how to use console.logging more as I see it's potential helpfulness, it's just not habit <span style='font-style: italic'>yet.</span>
                </p>

            <h3>Googling</h3>
            <figure style='float: right'>

            </figure>
                <p>
                    Google is amazing, if we don't know something we can search <span style='font-style: italic'>literally the sum of human knowledge</span> to get the 
                    answer. Unfortunately our own problems tend to be very specific, so it takes strong Google-fu to get the results that are helpful, and then some 
                    persistence, base knowledge, and a keen eye to discern what is actually useful for you <span style='font-style: italic'>right now.</span> It's not the quickest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've often be told that modern programme developers couldn't do their job without Google. There's too many languages, too many frameworks, 
                    too many niche terms, higher functions, and methods to remember all of them. So we let Google remember for us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I for one, embrace our Google coding overlords.
                </p>
                
            <h3>Asking peers and/or coaches for help</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm confident that I've learnt more from reading about and helping my fellow students than I have from doing content on my own. Problem solving is all about perspective 
                    and understanding, what better way to broaden your own than to listen to and consider your peers perspectives? Learning alongside other students is a great benefit to everyone involved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Talking to my mentors here at the Re-leased office, and the facilitators, is very helpful when I get stuck. They won't gve me the answer, just give me
                     a nudge in the right direction and provide an explanation (read: perspective) that is easier for someone with a more basic understanding to grasp.
                </p>
                <h>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
                <p>
                    Reflecting on your own processes can easily be an after thought. The problems solved, what more is to be done? Reflection reinforces our processes. 
                    It lets us consider if our approach was the correct one, how we could do better, or why we even had a problem to be solved in the first place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reflection is likely the most important part of the problem solving process. Without it we maintain bad habits, and find it difficult to grow and improve our processes.
                </p>
