  <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Welcome! My name is Scott and here is where I'll be practicing my website code writing skills. It's going to be a work in progress so stay with me as I learn and apply more. I'm currently living the Hawke's bay where I was born and raised, and summarily returned home after living in Melbourne, Wellington, and seeing a bit of the UK and France; home is always home.</p>
        <p>Before beginning the work at Enspiral Dev academy I was a bread baker making artisan breads in the traditional european style, I enjoy video games, board games, watching cricket, playing football, walking outdoor trails as a hobby. I like to cook, bake, consume media, and discuss various topics ranging from people to The Simpsons to food as an experience. I am characterised by my tall stature, nonexistent tan, an often unkept beard and a wry smile.</p>
    <p> It will eventually contain a list of links to all my blogs. </p>
